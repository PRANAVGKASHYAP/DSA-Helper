 thinking='The problem statement is clear and concise. It asks us to find the earliest index of a sensor reading that exceeds a given threshold. We can solve this problem by iterating through the array of sensor readings and checking if each element exceeds the threshold. If we find an element that exceeds the threshold, we return its index. If we reach the end of the array without finding any elements that exceed the threshold, we return -1.' code_complexity='Time: O(log n), Space: O(1)' code='def find_critical_reading(readings, threshold):\n\tfor i in range(len(readings)): \n\t\tif readings[i] > threshold:\n\t\t\treturn i\n\treturn -1'
