 thinking="The problem statement is clear and concise. It's a simple algorithmic problem that requires a straightforward approach. I will start by identifying the anomaly point by comparing each element to its predecessor. If an element is lower than its predecessor, it means that the sensor chain was re-spooled at that point. The time complexity of this solution is O(log N) because we only need to compare each element to its predecessor once." code_complexity='Time: O(log n), Space: O(1)' code='def find_anomaly_point(readings):\n\n    # Initialize the anomaly point to -1\n    anomaly_point = -1\n\n    # Iterate over the readings and compare each element to its predecessor\n    for i in range(len(readings) - 1):\n        if readings[i] > readings[i + 1]:\n            anomaly_point = i\n            break\n\n    # Return the anomaly point or -1 if no such drop exists\n    return anomaly_point'
