 thinking="The problem statement is clear and concise. It's a classic problem of finding the first occurrence of a pattern in a rotated array. The key challenge here is that the scores are integers, which can cause integer overflow issues if not handled properly. To solve this problem, we need to find a way to handle the integer overflow without compromising the time complexity. One approach is to use a modular arithmetic approach, where we treat the scores as if they were in a circular range of [0, 10^9]. This allows us to avoid the integer overflow issues and still maintain the correctness of the solution. Another important consideration is that the original sequence of scores is non-decreasing, which means that we can use a sliding window approach to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the rotated array. We can start with an empty window at the beginning of the array and gradually expand it as we move through the rotated array. As we encounter each score, we check if it's less than or equal to the critical performance threshold. If it is, we update the end index of the window to the current index. If not, we shrink the window by one element. Once we find a match, we return the start index of the window as the earliest checkpoint index where the condition is met. If no such match is found, we return -1." code_complexity='Time: O(log n), Space: O(1)' code='def detect_anomaly(scores, P, T):\n\t# Initialize the window with an empty range at the beginning of the array\n\twindow = (0, 0)\n\n\t# Iterate through the rotated array and check if each score is less than or equal to the critical performance threshold\n\tfor i in range(len(scores)): \n\t\tscore = scores[i] % 10**9\n\t\tif score <= T:\n\t\t\twindow = (window[0], i)\n\t\telse:\n\t\t\twindow = (window[1] + 1, window[1] + 1)\n\n\t# If no match is found, return -1\n\tif window[0] == window[1]: \n\t\treturn -1\n\n\t# Otherwise, return the start index of the window as the earliest checkpoint index where the condition is met\n\treturn window[0]'
