      "['The article \"Top 10 Most Asked Binary Search Interview Questions\" by Kirti Arora outlines essential binary search problems frequently encountered in technical interviews, highlighting the algorithm\\'s O(log n) time complexity. It covers a range of scenarios, from basic implementation to more complex adaptations.\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of the key questions and their technical/coding aspects:\\n\\n1.  **Basic Binary Search:** Implements the core iterative or recursive approach to find a target in a sorted array, moving `left` and `right` pointers based on comparison with the `mid` element.\\n2.  **Find the First and Last Position of an Element in a Sorted Array:** Requires two modified binary searches; one to find the first occurrence by continuing to search left after finding the target, and another to find the last by continuing to search right.\\n3.  **Search Insert Position:** Determines the index where a target should be inserted in a sorted array if not found, by adjusting `pos` when `nums[mid] >= target` and reducing the search space to `high = mid - 1`.\\n4.  **Find the Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix:** While the article provides a solution using a `PriorityQueue` (max-heap) to keep track of the `k` smallest elements, this particular solution has a time complexity of O(N^2 log k) which is not typically a binary search approach for this problem. A more efficient binary search approach for this problem would involve binary searching on the *value* of the k-th smallest element.\\n5.  **Square Root of a Number:** Uses binary search to find the integer square root by searching for a number `mid` such that `mid * mid <= x` and `(mid+1) * (mid+1) > x`, iteratively narrowing the range.\\n6.  **Search in Rotated Sorted Array:** Adapts binary search by identifying the sorted half of the array (either `nums[si] <= nums[mid]` or `nums[mid] <= nums[ei]`) and then checking if the target falls within that sorted range to decide which half to search next.\\n7.  **Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array:** Applies binary search to locate the pivot point, continuously updating the `min` value and moving pointers based on whether the left half (`nums[low] <= nums[mid]`) or right half is sorted, aiming for the unsorted part to find the minimum.\\n8.  **Find Peak Element:** Modifies binary search to find an element greater than its neighbors, handling edge cases for arrays of size 1 or peaks at the ends. It checks `nums[mid-1] < nums[mid] && nums[mid] > nums[mid+1]` and moves `l` or `h` accordingly.\\n9.  **Find the Duplicate Number:** This problem, while often solvable with binary search on the range of values, the article\\'s provided solution uses Floyd\\'s Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare), which detects a cycle in a linked list and has O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity without modifying the array.\\n10. **Median of Two Sorted Arrays:** Solves this by combining binary search with a partitioning logic. The algorithm performs a binary search on the smaller array (`nums1`) to find a partition point (`mid1`) such that when combined with a corresponding partition (`mid2`) from `nums2`, the elements on the left are less than or equal to elements on the right. It handles both odd and even total lengths for the median calculation, achieving a time complexity of O(log(min(m,n))).\\n\\nThe article emphasizes that mastering these binary search variations is crucial for interview preparation. Although the provided snippet also mentions the \"sliding window technique,\" the core article focuses exclusively on binary search problems.', '\\nThe Lenovo article \"Binary Search: Key Concepts and Practical Applications\" defines binary search as an efficient algorithm for finding a specific target element within a *sorted array*. It operates by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, effectively eliminating half of the remaining elements with each comparison until the target is found or the interval is empty.\\n\\n**Key Technical and Coding Aspects:**\\n\\n*   **How it Works:** The algorithm compares the target value with the middle element of the array. If they match, the search is successful. If the target is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half; otherwise, it continues in the upper half.\\n*   **Efficiency:** Binary search boasts a time complexity of **O(log n)**, where \\'n\\' is the number of elements in the array. This logarithmic growth means that search time increases much slower than the array size, making it exceptionally efficient for large datasets.\\n*   **Use Cases:** It\\'s ideal for large, sorted datasets where quick checks for element existence or repeated searches are necessary.\\n*   **Data Structures:** While commonly used with arrays due to their efficient random access, binary search can be adapted for other sorted data structures like trees or lists, provided they support efficient element access.\\n*   **Recursive Implementation:** Binary search can be implemented recursively, dividing the search interval in half with each recursive call. This approach often results in concise and elegant code that is easier to understand and maintain.\\n*   **Advantages:** Its efficiency (O(log n)) allows for fast searches in large datasets, ensuring scalability. Additionally, its straightforward implementation using basic programming constructs makes it easy to understand and utilize.\\n*   **Handling Duplicates:** In its basic form, binary search typically returns the index of the first occurrence of the target. However, it can be modified to find the last occurrence or count occurrences by adjusting the algorithm.\\n*   **Limitations:** Binary search *requires the data to be sorted*. If an array is unsorted, it must first be sorted, which adds an extra step and potentially increases overall time complexity. For very small datasets, the overhead of sorting might make a linear search more appropriate.\\n*   **Empty Arrays and Out-of-Bounds:** When applied to an empty array, the search will fail. It\\'s crucial to handle such edge cases to prevent errors. The algorithm typically prevents out-of-bounds errors by validating the search interval before attempting to access elements.\\n*   **Non-Numeric and Floating-Point Data:** Binary search can be used with non-numeric data (like strings or objects) if it\\'s sorted. When working with floating-point numbers, careful handling of precision issues, rounding errors, and appropriate comparison techniques are necessary.\\n*   **Overflows:** Potential overflows in calculations (e.g., when calculating `mid`) need to be managed using larger data types or by checking for overflow conditions to avoid unexpected results.\\n*   **Linked Lists:** While technically possible, binary search is not commonly used with linked lists due to their inefficient random access, as it relies on quickly accessing middle elements.\\n*   **Finding Min/Max:** Binary search can be adapted to find the minimum or maximum value in a sorted array by modifying the search condition.', 'The GeeksforGeeks article \"Binary Search\" provides a comprehensive overview of this fundamental searching algorithm, emphasizing its efficiency and broad applicability. Binary search operates on a *sorted* or *monotonic* search space, repeatedly halving the search interval until the target value is found or the space is exhausted.\\n\\n**Key Concepts and Algorithm:**\\n\\n*   **Prerequisites:** The data structure must be sorted, and access to any element should take constant time (e.g., an array).\\n*   **Algorithm Steps:**\\n    1.  Divide the search space into two halves by finding the middle index (`mid`).\\n    2.  Compare the middle element with the `key` (target value).\\n    3.  If `key` is found at `mid`, the process terminates.\\n    4.  If `key` is smaller than the middle element, the search continues in the *left half*.\\n    5.  If `key` is larger than the middle element, the search continues in the *right half*.\\n    6.  This process repeats until the `key` is found or the search space is exhausted.\\n\\n**Implementation Methods:**\\n\\nThe article details two primary ways to implement binary search:\\n\\n1.  **Iterative Binary Search:**\\n    *   Uses a `while` loop to manage the `low` and `high` pointers.\\n    *   In each iteration, `mid` is calculated as `low + (high - low) / 2` to prevent potential integer overflow compared to `(low + high) / 2`.\\n    *   Pointers `low` and `high` are adjusted based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with the target `x`.\\n    *   Returns the index if found, otherwise -1.\\n    *   **Time Complexity:** O(log N) in average and worst cases, O(1) in best case.\\n    *   **Auxiliary Space:** O(1).\\n    *   Code examples are provided in C++, C, Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, and PHP.\\n\\n2.  **Recursive Binary Search:**\\n    *   Involves a recursive function that compares the `mid` element with the `key`.\\n    *   If `arr[mid]` equals `x`, the index is returned.\\n    *   If `arr[mid]` is greater than `x`, the function recursively calls itself for the left subarray (`low` to `mid - 1`).\\n    *   If `arr[mid]` is less than `x`, it recursively calls itself for the right subarray (`mid + 1` to `high`).\\n    *   The base case for recursion is when `high < low`, indicating the element is not present, and -1 is returned.\\n    *   **Time Complexity:** O(log N) in average and worst cases, O(1) in best case.\\n    *   **Auxiliary Space:** O(log N) due to the recursive call stack.\\n    *   Code examples are provided in C++, C, Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, and PHP.\\n\\n**Complexity Analysis:**\\n\\n*   **Time Complexity:**\\n    *   **Best Case:** O(1) (when the target is the middle element on the first comparison).\\n    *   **Average Case:** O(log N).\\n    *   **Worst Case:** O(log N).\\n*   **Auxiliary Space:**\\n    *   O(1) for iterative implementation.\\n    *   O(log N) for recursive implementation (due to the call stack).\\n\\n**Applications of Binary Search:**\\n\\nThe article lists numerous practical applications:\\n*   Searching in sorted arrays.\\n*   Finding the first/last occurrence or closest match in a sorted array.\\n*   Database indexing (e.g., B-trees).\\n*   Debugging in version control systems (like `git bisect`).\\n*   Network routing and IP lookup.\\n*   File systems and libraries for fast lookups in sorted directories/symbol tables.\\n*   Gaming/graphics for collision detection or ray tracing with sorted spatial data.\\n*   Machine learning for hyperparameter tuning.\\n*   Optimization problems and competitive programming to narrow search space.\\n*   Foundation for advanced data structures (e.g., Binary Search Trees, self-balancing BSTs).\\n\\nThe article also links to various problems based on binary search, such as \"Square Root of Integer,\" \"First and Last Positions in a sorted array,\" and \"Minimum in a sorted rotated array.\"']\n",
