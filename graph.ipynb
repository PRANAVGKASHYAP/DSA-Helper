      "['The Medium article \"Top 10 Most Asked Binary Search Interview Questions\" by Kirti Arora discusses ten frequently encountered binary search problems in technical interviews, emphasizing the algorithm\\'s O(log n) time complexity for sorted data structures.\\n\\nThe article covers:\\n1.  **Basic Binary Search**: Implementation for finding a target element in a sorted array, typically using iterative or recursive methods. A Java iterative solution is provided.\\n2.  **Find the First and Last Position of an Element in a Sorted Array**: Requires modifying binary search to locate both the first and last occurrences of a target value, returning `[-1, -1]` if not found. Separate helper functions `findFirst` and `findSecond` are used, adjusting the search range after finding a potential match.\\n3.  **Search Insert Position**: Determines where a target value should be inserted into a sorted array to maintain order, returning its index if found or the insertion point otherwise.\\n4.  **Find the Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix**: Solved using a max-priority queue (min-heap in Java with `Comparator.reverseOrder()`) to keep track of the `k` smallest elements encountered while iterating through the matrix, ensuring the largest element in the priority queue is eventually the kth smallest overall.\\n5.  **Square Root of a Number**: Computes the integer square root of a non-negative integer `x` by narrowing down the possible range using binary search, returning the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`.\\n6.  **Search in Rotated Sorted Array**: Adapts binary search to find a target in a sorted array that has been rotated at an unknown pivot, by identifying which half of the current search range is sorted and adjusting `low` and `high` accordingly.\\n7.  **Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array**: Uses binary search to locate the pivot point in a rotated sorted array, which corresponds to the minimum element. The minimum is updated based on `nums[low]` or `nums[mid]` depending on the sorted segment.\\n8.  **Find Peak Element**: Identifies an element greater than its immediate neighbors in an array. Edge cases for arrays of length 1 or peaks at the ends are handled, and binary search moves towards the increasing side if not at a peak.\\n9.  **Find the Duplicate Number**: This problem, requiring O(1) extra space and no modification of the array, is solved using Floyd\\'s Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Hare and Tortoise), which detects a cycle in a linked list-like structure formed by array elements as pointers.\\n10. **Median of Two Sorted Arrays**: Combines binary search with partitioning logic to find the median of two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` in `O(log(min(m,n)))` time complexity by ensuring partitions create equal halves of the combined sorted array.', 'The Binary Search Algorithm in Java is a highly efficient method for finding an element within a *sorted* list or array. It operates on a \"divide and conquer\" principle, repeatedly halving the search space until the target value is found or the search space is exhausted. This approach significantly reduces the time complexity compared to linear search.\\n\\n**Key Concepts and Working Principle:**\\n\\n*   **Sorted Data Requirement**: Binary search is strictly applicable only to sorted arrays. If the input array is not sorted, the algorithm will not work correctly, and its behavior will be undefined.\\n*   **Divide and Conquer**: The algorithm starts by examining the middle element of the sorted array.\\n    *   If the middle element matches the target, the search is complete.\\n    *   If the target is less than the middle element, the algorithm discards the right half of the array and continues searching in the left half.\\n    *   If the target is greater than the middle element, it discards the left half and searches in the right half.\\n    *   This process of halving the search space continues until the target is found or no elements remain in the search space.\\n\\n**Performance Considerations:**\\n\\n*   **Time Complexity**: Binary search boasts a logarithmic time complexity of O(log n), which is significantly faster than the O(n) of linear search, especially for large datasets. For example, searching a million-element array with binary search might take around 20 comparisons, while linear search could take up to a million.\\n*   **Space Complexity**: It is space-efficient, requiring O(1) extra space as it operates directly on the input array without needing additional data structures for intermediate results.\\n*   **Predictable Performance**: Binary search offers predictable worst-case performance, making it suitable for real-time systems where consistent response times are crucial.\\n\\n**Implementation Strategies in Java:**\\n\\nBinary search can be implemented using two main approaches:\\n\\n1.  **Iterative Approach**:\\n    *   This method uses a `while` loop to repeatedly divide the search space.\\n    *   It maintains three variables: `low` (start position), `high` (end position), and `mid` (middle element\\'s position).\\n    *   The `mid` index is often calculated as `low + (high - low) / 2` to prevent integer overflow, which can occur if `(low + high)` exceeds the maximum integer value.\\n    *   The loop continues as long as `low <= high`. If the target is found, its index is returned. Otherwise, `low` or `high` is updated, eliminating half of the search space. If the loop finishes, `-1` (or another indicator) is returned, signifying the target was not found.\\n\\n    ```java\\n    public static int iterativeBinarySearch(int[] arr, int target) {\\n        int low = 0;\\n        int high = arr.length - 1;\\n\\n        while (low <= high) {\\n            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; // Prevents integer overflow\\n            if (arr[mid] == target) {\\n                return mid; // Target found\\n            } else if (arr[mid] < target) {\\n                low = mid + 1; // Search in the right half\\n            } else {\\n                high = mid - 1; // Search in the left half\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return -1; // Target not found\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n2.  **Recursive Approach**:\\n    *   This approach defines a function that calls itself with updated search boundaries.\\n    *   The base case for recursion is when `low > high`, indicating the target is not found, and `-1` is returned.\\n    *   Similar to the iterative method, `mid` is calculated, and the target is compared with `arr[mid]`. Recursive calls are then made on the appropriate half (left or right) of the array.\\n\\n    ```java\\n    public static int recursiveBinarySearch(int[] arr, int target, int low, int high) {\\n        if (low > high) {\\n            return -1; // Target not found\\n        }\\n        int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;\\n        if (arr[mid] == target) {\\n            return mid;\\n        } else if (arr[mid] < target) {\\n            return recursiveBinarySearch(arr, target, mid + 1, high);\\n        } else {\\n            return recursiveBinarySearch(arr, target, low, mid - 1);\\n        }\\n    }\\n    ```\\n\\n**Choosing Between Iterative and Recursive:**\\n\\n*   Iterative implementations are often slightly faster due to the absence of function call overhead.\\n*   Recursive solutions can be more concise and elegant, but deep recursion might lead to stack overflow issues for very large arrays.\\n*   The choice often depends on programmer preference, coding conventions, and performance criticality.\\n\\n**Common Mistakes and Pitfalls:**\\n\\n1.  **Integer Overflow**: Calculating `mid = (low + high) / 2` can lead to overflow if `low` and `high` are large. The safe method is `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.\\n2.  **Unsorted Arrays**: Applying binary search to an unsorted array will yield incorrect results.\\n3.  **Off-by-One Errors**: Incorrect comparison operators (e.g., `<` instead of `<=`) or mistakes in updating `low` and `high` can lead to infinite loops or missed elements. Using loop invariants can help prevent these errors.\\n4.  **Not Handling Target Not Found**: The algorithm must explicitly return a specific value (e.g., -1) or throw an exception if the target element is not present.\\n\\n**Variations and Extensions:**\\n\\nBeyond a simple exact match, binary search can be adapted for:\\n\\n*   **Finding the First/Last Occurrence**: Useful when duplicates are present, requiring adjustments to the search range even after a match is found to continue searching in the relevant half.\\n*   **Finding Elements Around the Target**: Locating the closest element, or the element just greater than/less than the target, which is useful for insertion points or approximations.\\n*   **Different Data Structures**: While primarily for arrays, its principle can be extended to other sorted data structures like Sorted Linked Lists (with some traversal overhead), Balanced Search Trees (AVL, Red-Black trees), and B-Trees, where the hierarchical and sorted nature allows for logarithmic search performance.\\n\\n**Real-World Applications:**\\n\\nBinary search is fundamental in various applications, including:\\n\\n*   **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**: For quick record retrieval using indexes.\\n*   **In-Memory Data Structures**: Efficiently searching large datasets in memory like stock tickers or routing tables.\\n*   **Machine Learning and AI**: For quickly finding training samples or nearest neighbors in sorted datasets.', \"\\n\\nBinary search is an efficient algorithm used to find a specific target element within a sorted array, working by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. This process eliminates half of the remaining elements with each comparison until the target is found or the search interval becomes empty.\\n\\n**Key Concepts and Working Principle:**\\nBinary search is exclusively applicable to *sorted* arrays or data structures. The algorithm begins by comparing the target value with the middle element of the array. If they match, the search is successful. If the target is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half of the array; otherwise, it proceeds to the upper half.\\n\\n**Efficiency and Performance:**\\nBinary search boasts a time complexity of O(log n), where 'n' is the number of elements in the array. This logarithmic growth means that search time increases very slowly as the dataset size grows, making it highly efficient for large datasets where speed is crucial. Its efficiency and simplicity are significant advantages, ensuring fast searches and scalability.\\n\\n**Implementation Aspects:**\\nBinary search can be implemented using both iterative and recursive approaches. The recursive method divides the search interval in half with each recursive call, offering a concise and elegant solution. It's crucial to handle edge cases like empty arrays or unsorted data, as binary search relies heavily on the data being sorted.\\n\\n**Versatility and Applications:**\\nWhile commonly used with arrays due to their efficient random access, binary search can be adapted for other sorted data structures like trees or lists, provided they support efficient element access. It can also be modified to handle duplicates, find the first or last occurrence of an element, or even locate minimum/maximum values in a sorted array. Binary search is suitable for real-time applications, such as search engines and database queries, where quick searches are vital. It can work with non-numeric data, including strings and objects, if they are sorted, and can also be used with floating-point numbers with careful consideration for precision issues. However, for very small datasets, the overhead of sorting for binary search might outweigh its benefits, making linear search a more suitable alternative. Applying binary search to a linked list is generally inefficient due to the lack of random access.\"]\n",

      " thinking=\"The problem statement is clear and concise. It's a classic problem of finding the first occurrence of a pattern in a rotated array. The key challenge here is that the scores are integers, which can cause integer overflow issues if not handled properly. To solve this problem, we need to find a way to handle the integer overflow without compromising the time complexity. One approach is to use a modular arithmetic approach, where we treat the scores as if they were in a circular range of [0, 10^9]. This allows us to avoid the integer overflow issues and still maintain the correctness of the solution. Another important consideration is that the original sequence of scores is non-decreasing, which means that we can use a sliding window approach to find the first occurrence of the pattern in the rotated array. We can start with an empty window at the beginning of the array and gradually expand it as we move through the rotated array. As we encounter each score, we check if it's less than or equal to the critical performance threshold. If it is, we update the end index of the window to the current index. If not, we shrink the window by one element. Once we find a match, we return the start index of the window as the earliest checkpoint index where the condition is met.
