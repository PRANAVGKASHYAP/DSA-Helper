      "['The article \"Top 10 Most Asked Binary Search Interview Questions\" by Kirti Arora discusses binary search as a fundamental algorithm with O(log n) time complexity, crucial for technical interviews. It outlines ten common interview questions, providing problem statements and Java code solutions for each.\\n\\nThe questions covered include:\\n1.  **Basic Binary Search:** Implementing iterative or recursive approaches to find a target in a sorted array.\\n2.  **Find the First and Last Position of an Element in a Sorted Array:** Modifying binary search to locate both the starting and ending indices of a target value.\\n3.  **Search Insert Position:** Determining the index of a target in a sorted array, or where it would be inserted if not found.\\n4.  **Find the Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix:** Utilizing a max-priority queue to find the kth smallest element in a row and column-sorted matrix.\\n5.  **Square Root of a Number:** Computing the integer square root of a given number using binary search to narrow down the range.\\n6.  **Search in Rotated Sorted Array:** Adapting binary search to handle arrays rotated at an unknown pivot, by identifying the sorted half.\\n7.  **Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array:** Applying binary search to locate the pivot point, which reveals the minimum element in a rotated sorted array.\\n8.  **Find Peak Element:** Modifying binary search to find an element greater than its neighbors, by checking neighbors and moving towards the peak.\\n9.  **Find the Duplicate Number:** Solving this without modifying the array or using extra space, often done using the Floyd\\'s cycle-finding algorithm (though the problem is listed under binary search, the provided solution uses a two-pointer approach similar to linked list cycle detection).\\n10. **Median of Two Sorted Arrays:** Combining binary search with partitioning logic to efficiently find the median of two sorted arrays.\\n\\nThe article emphasizes that understanding these problems and efficiently applying solutions is key to mastering binary search for interviews. The provided snippet mentions the sliding window technique, which is a powerful approach for array and string problems, but it\\'s listed under \"Recommended from Medium\" and not directly part of the \"Top 10 Binary Search Questions\" list itself.', 'The article \"Binary Search Algorithm in Java: Implementation and Key Concepts\" from Index.dev provides a detailed guide to the binary search algorithm, a fundamental search technique in computer science known for its efficiency. The article highlights its importance, working mechanism, implementation strategies, performance considerations, real-world applications, strengths, weaknesses, and common pitfalls, particularly within the context of Java.\\n\\n**What is Binary Search Algorithm?**\\nBinary search is a fast search algorithm that works on sorted arrays. It operates on a \"divide and conquer\" principle, continually halving the search space until the target value is found or the search space is exhausted. This approach significantly reduces the time complexity compared to linear search.\\n\\n**Why is it Important?**\\nBinary search is crucial for several reasons:\\n*   **Ease of Implementation:** It\\'s relatively simple to understand and implement.\\n*   **High Efficiency:** Especially for large datasets, it offers a logarithmic time complexity (O(log n)), making it highly efficient for fast data processing.\\n*   **Scalability:** Its logarithmic time complexity ensures efficient performance even with millions or billions of elements.\\n\\n**How Does it Work?**\\nThe algorithm begins by examining the middle element of a sorted array.\\n1.  If the middle element matches the target, the search is successful.\\n2.  If the target is smaller than the middle element, the search continues in the left half of the array.\\n3.  If the target is larger, the search continues in the right half.\\nThis process of halving the search space repeats until the target is found or no elements remain in the search space.\\n\\n**Implementation Strategies in Java**\\nBinary search can be implemented in two primary ways:\\n*   **Iterative Approach:** Uses a `while` loop to repeatedly narrow down the search space. It maintains `low`, `high`, and `mid` indices. The `mid` index is calculated as `low + (high - low) / 2` to prevent integer overflow.\\n    *   **Explanation:** `low` tracks the start, `high` tracks the end, and `mid` is the current middle. If `arr[mid]` equals the target, `mid` is returned. If `target` is greater, `low` becomes `mid + 1`. If `target` is smaller, `high` becomes `mid - 1`. The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.\\n*   **Recursive Approach:** Involves a function that calls itself with updated search boundaries.\\n    *   **Explanation:** The base case is when `low > high`, indicating the target isn\\'t found, returning -1. Otherwise, `mid` is calculated. If `arr[mid]` equals the target, `mid` is returned. If `arr[mid]` is less than the target, the function recursively calls itself on the right half (`mid + 1`, `high`). If `arr[mid]` is greater, it calls itself on the left half (`low`, `mid - 1`).\\n\\n**Choosing the Right Approach:**\\nThe choice often depends on programmer preference and coding conventions. Iterative implementations might be slightly faster due to the absence of function call overhead. Recursive solutions can be more concise and elegant, and some languages offer tail-call optimization to mitigate performance differences.\\n\\n**Performance Considerations:**\\nBoth iterative and recursive implementations have a time complexity of O(log n), which is significantly better than linear search\\'s O(n). Iterative solutions typically have slightly better performance due to less overhead from function calls.\\n\\n**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\\n\\n**Advantages:**\\n*   **Logarithmic Time Complexity (O(log n)):** Offers significantly faster searches, especially for large datasets (e.g., 20 comparisons for a million elements vs. a million for linear search).\\n*   **Space Efficiency:** Requires minimal additional space (O(1)) as it operates directly on the input array.\\n*   **Predictable Performance:** Its worst-case complexity is well-defined, making it suitable for real-time systems.\\n*   **Versatility:** Serves as a foundation for more complex algorithms like interpolation search.\\n*   **Error Detection:** Can indirectly help detect unsorted data if the target isn\\'t found, implying a sorting irregularity.\\n\\n**Disadvantages:**\\n*   **Requires Sorted Data:** This is a strict prerequisite; binary search fails on unsorted arrays, often requiring a pre-sorting step which adds overhead.\\n*   **Memory and Recursion Overhead:** Recursive implementations can lead to stack overflow for very deep searches due to call stack usage. Iterative approaches, while longer, avoid this.\\n*   **Caching Considerations:** The random access pattern might be less beneficial for CPU caching compared to linear search in some scenarios.\\n*   **Error-Prone Logic:** Careful handling is needed for choosing the middle element, duplicate values, and boundary conditions to avoid off-by-one errors or infinite loops.\\n*   **Limited Functionality:** Primarily designed for finding specific items; less effective for tasks like counting all elements within a range.\\n\\n**Common Mistakes and Pitfalls:**\\n1.  **Integer Overflow:** Calculating `mid = (low + high) / 2` can cause overflow if `low + high` exceeds the `int` limit. The safer approach is `mid = low + (high - low) / 2`.\\n2.  **Unsorted Arrays:** Forgetting to ensure the array is sorted before applying binary search.\\n3.  **Off-by-One Errors:** Incorrect comparison operators (e.g., `<` instead of `<=`) or boundary updates can lead to infinite loops or wrong results.\\n4.  **Not Handling \"Target Not Found\":** Failing to return an appropriate indicator (like -1) when the target element is not present.\\n5.  **Choosing Recursion Over Iteration (and vice-versa) Unwisely:** While recursion can be elegant, iterative might be better for performance-critical tasks or to avoid stack overflow with very large datasets.\\n\\n**Beyond the Fundamentals (Variations and Extensions):**\\nThe article also touches on advanced concepts like:\\n*   **Finding First/Last Occurrence:** Modifying binary search to locate the first or last instance of a duplicate element.\\n*   **Finding Elements Around the Target:** Adapting it to find elements closest to the target or the insertion point for a new element.\\n*   **Optimizing Performance:** Strategies include pre-sorting, using primitive data types, loop unrolling (with caution), and hybrid approaches.\\n\\n**Real-World Applications:**\\n*   **Database Management Systems (DBMS):** Used for quick record searches by leveraging indexes.\\n*   **In-Memory Data Structures:** Efficiently accessing large datasets like stock tickers or network routing tables.\\n*   **Machine Learning and AI:** Fast searching in sorted datasets for training and classification, such as in k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithms.\\n\\n**Variations and Extensions to Other Data Structures:**\\nWhile typically associated with arrays, binary search concepts can be applied to:\\n*   **Sorted Linked Lists:** Requires maintaining node counts and traversing to find the middle, but still aims for O(log n) time.\\n*   **Balanced Search Trees (AVL, Red-Black Trees):** Binary search naturally translates to tree traversal, maintaining O(log n) due to self-balancing properties.\\n*   **B-Trees:** Optimized for disk-stored data, where binary search can be used within nodes to find the correct child pointer, achieving O(log n) performance for large datasets.\\n\\nIn summary, binary search is a powerful and efficient algorithm for sorted data, crucial for any developer\\'s toolkit, but requires careful implementation and consideration of its constraints and nuances for optimal performance.', '\\nThe Lenovo.com glossary entry defines binary search as an efficient algorithm for finding a target element in a **sorted array** by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. This process eliminates half of the remaining elements with each comparison until the target is found or the interval is empty. It boasts a time complexity of O(log n), making it particularly effective for large datasets where efficiency is critical.\\n\\nTechnically, binary search works by comparing the target value with the middle element of the array. If they match, the search is successful; if the target is less than the middle, the search continues in the lower half; otherwise, it proceeds in the upper half. This divide-and-conquer approach can be implemented both iteratively and recursively, with recursive implementations often lauded for their concise and elegant code.\\n\\nWhile commonly associated with arrays due to efficient random access, binary search can be adapted to other sorted data structures like trees or lists. Key advantages include its O(log n) efficiency and relative simplicity of implementation. However, it strictly requires the data to be sorted, and applying it to an unsorted array necessitates a prior sorting step, adding to the overall complexity. Handling duplicates typically involves finding the first occurrence, with modifications needed for finding the last occurrence or counting. For very small datasets, the overhead of sorting might make simpler linear search more appropriate. The article also notes that binary search can work with non-numeric and floating-point data, though precision issues must be considered for the latter, and overflow scenarios need appropriate handling. Applying binary search to an empty array will result in failure.']\n",
