        text="""The Medium article "Top 10 Most Asked Binary Search Interview Questions" by Kirti Arora comprehensively covers essential binary search problems frequently encountered in technical interviews, emphasizing its O(log n) efficiency for sorted data structures. It begins with the "Basic Binary Search" implementation, then progresses to "Find the First and Last Position of an Element in a Sorted Array," which requires modifying the standard algorithm to locate boundary indices. "Search Insert Position" determines where a target would be inserted to maintain sorted order. The article also includes "Find the Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix," utilizing a priority queue approach, and "Square Root of a Number," which applies binary search to narrow down the possible integer square root.

Further challenges include "Search in Rotated Sorted Array" and "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array," both of which adapt binary search to handle array rotations by identifying the sorted half. "Find Peak Element" extends the technique to locate an element greater than its neighbors. The "Find the duplicate number" problem, although not a direct binary search, is presented with a Floyd's cycle-finding algorithm due to its common pairing with array problems, demonstrating a non-modifying, constant-space solution. Finally, "Median of Two Sorted Arrays" showcases a more advanced application of binary search combined with partitioning to efficiently find the median of two merged sorted arrays. Each problem is accompanied by a Java code snippet illustrating its solution."""

        text="""The GeeksforGeeks article "Most Asked Binary Search Interview Questions" highlights binary search as an highly efficient searching algorithm with a time complexity of O(log N) for sorted arrays, based on the Divide and Conquer technique. It specifies that binary search is applicable when the answer lies within a range [L, R] and exhibits monotonic behavior.

The article presents a comprehensive list of commonly asked binary search interview problems, including:
*   **Lower and Upper Bound:** Finding the first element not less than a given value (lower bound) and the first element greater than a given value (upper bound).
*   **Search Insert Position:** Determining where a target value would be inserted in a sorted array to maintain its sorted order.
*   **Sqrt(x):** Computing the integer square root of a given non-negative integer.
*   **First and Last occurrence of a number:** Finding the first and last indices of a given target value in a sorted array.
*   **Search in sorted rotated array (I and II):** Adapting binary search to find an element in a sorted array that has been rotated at some unknown pivot. The "II" variant typically involves duplicate elements.
*   **Min element in sorted rotated array:** Finding the minimum element in a sorted array that has been rotated.
*   **Find peak element in a mountain array / Find Peak element II:** Identifying an element that is greater than its immediate neighbors in a mountain array (unimodal array). "Find Peak element II" might refer to a 2D array.
*   **Koko Eating Bananas:** A problem where binary search is used to find the minimum eating speed for Koko to finish all bananas within a given time.
*   **Allocate Books:** Distributing books among students such that the maximum number of pages a student has to read is minimized.
*   **Aggressive Cows:** Placing cows in stalls such that the minimum distance between any two cows is maximized.
*   **Minimize max distance to gas station:** Placing a certain number of new gas stations to minimize the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations.
*   **Capacity to ship packages within D days:** Finding the minimum shipping capacity required to ship all packages within a specified number of days.
*   **Median of 2 sorted arrays:** Finding the median of two sorted arrays combined.
*   **Nth root of a number:** Calculating the nth root of a given number.
*   **Kth element of 2 sorted arrays:** Finding the Kth smallest element when two sorted arrays are merged.
*   **Find Median in row wise sorted array:** Finding the median of a matrix where each row is sorted.
*   **Search in row wise and column wise sorted array:** Searching for an element in a matrix where both rows and columns are sorted.

The article also details the complexity analysis of binary search, stating a best-case time complexity of O(1), and an average/worst-case time complexity of O(log N). The auxiliary space complexity is O(1) for iterative implementations, and O(log N) if recursive call stack space is considered. It also briefly mentions variants such as Meta Binary Search, Ubiquitous binary search, Uniform binary search, Randomized binary search, and N-base-modified-binary-search."""

      Part(
        text="""The Medium article "Mastering Binary Search: Concepts, LeetCode Examples, and Real-World Applications" by Lagu provides a comprehensive guide to binary search, emphasizing its efficiency and versatility. Binary search is presented as a divide-and-conquer algorithm that efficiently finds an element in a *sorted* list by repeatedly halving the search interval. It achieves a time complexity of O(log n) due to this approach, significantly outperforming brute force O(n) search, while its space complexity is O(1) for iterative implementations and O(log n) for recursive ones due to the call stack.

The article outlines when to use binary search, specifically when data is sorted or can be logically sorted, giving examples like finding a target in a sorted array, searching a rotated sorted array, or performing a predicate search. It provides C# code implementations for both iterative and recursive binary search, highlighting the use of `mid = left + (right - left) / 2` to prevent integer overflow.

Two LeetCode examples are detailed: "33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array" and "410. Split Array Largest Sum". For the rotated array problem, the key idea is to determine which half of the array is sorted and then decide where to continue the search. For "Split Array Largest Sum," binary search is applied to the *answer* (the minimal largest sum), with a helper function to check if a given `maxSum` allows splitting the array into `k` or fewer subarrays. The search space for this problem ranges from `max(nums)` to `sum(nums)`.

Finally, the article explores real-world applications of binary search, including:
*   **Databases:** Optimizing query performance by searching indexed records, like in B-trees.
*   **Gaming:** Fine-tuning parameters such as rendering distances or collision detection thresholds.
*   **Statistics:** Locating values within sorted probability distributions for simulations like Monte Carlo, to speed up generating random samples.
*   **Machine Learning:** Optimizing thresholds for classification problems, such as in spam filters, to maximize metrics like accuracy or precision.

The author also cautions against common pitfalls, such as off-by-one errors, integer overflow, and neglecting edge cases like empty or single-element arrays and duplicates."""
