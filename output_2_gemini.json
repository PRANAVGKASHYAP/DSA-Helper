  "description": "The Binary Search Algorithm is an efficient search algorithm designed to locate a specific target element within a sorted array. Operating on the \"divide and conquer\" principle, it repeatedly divides the search interval in half, comparing the target with the middle element and adjusting the search range until the target is found or the interval is empty, achieving a run-time complexity of O(log n).",
