Balance the oxygen atoms on both sides: There are a total of 35 O atoms on the right hand, and the coefficient for O2 should be 11. [...] An equation can be used to describe a physical reaction, which involves a change of states. For example, melting, sublimation, evaporation, and condensation can be represented as follows. In these equations, (s) stands for solid, (l) for liquid (l), and (g) for gas.\n\n melting: H2O(s)\u2192H2O(l)\n sublimation: H2O(s)\u2192H2O(g)\n evaporation: C2H5OH(l)\u2192C2H5OH(g)\n condensation: NH3(g)\u2192NH3(l)",
    "compressed_content": "The refined summary remains the same as before:\n\nThis appears to be the home page of a chemistry textbook or online resource, specifically focusing on reaction equations. It offers various features such as searching, table of contents, learning objects, and instructor resources. The site provides explanations of chemical reactions, including the formation of new substances through the breaking and forming of chemical bonds at the molecular level. Chemical reactions are characterized by changes in the phase or physical appearance of reactants, often accompanied by energy release in the form of heat, light, sound, odor, or gas production.\n\nThe site emphasizes the importance of understanding chemical properties, including reactivity, to study chemical reactions. It highlights the significance of writing a balanced chemical reaction equation to describe a reaction, as it indicates the mole relationships of reactants and products, and often includes information about energy involved in the reaction. The concept of reaction stoichiometry is introduced, which deals with the quantitative aspect of chemical reactions.\n\nThe site also discusses how to write balanced reaction equations, including:\n\n* Determining the reactants and products\n* Applying the fundamental principle of conservation of atoms\n* Balancing one type of atoms at a time\n* Balancing all types of atoms\n\nExamples are provided, such as the oxidation reaction of sugar, which illustrates the methods used for writing balanced reaction equations. Additionally, examples illustrate the steps involved in writing a balanced equation for a chemical reaction, including determining reactants and products, applying the principle of conservation of atoms, and balancing all types of atoms.\n\nThe site also discusses the importance of considering the ionic nature of solutions when writing balanced reaction equations, as seen in example where the precipitation of AgCl is formed through the combination of Cl- and Ag+ ions. Furthermore, it touches on topics related to chemical reactions, including excess and limiting reagents, features of chemical reactions, chemical kinetics, and reaction mechanism.\n\nNote: The new chunk provided does not add any new information to the existing summary, so the refined summary remains unchanged."

[...] Stoichiometry:\n\nStoichiometry is the part of chemistry that deals with the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in a chemical reaction. Stoichiometry is crucial for predicting the outcomes of reactions, optimizing reactant use, and determining reaction yields and limiting reactants. Balanced chemical equations serve as the foundation of stoichiometric calculations, ensuring that mass and atoms are conserved in chemical reactions.
